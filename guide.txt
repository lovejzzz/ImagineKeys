Physical Modeling Piano-Building Game: Simplified Design and Development Guidance

Overview

The game is an interactive, web-based grand piano-building simulator focused on simplicity and ease of use. Players visually resize a minimalistic piano silhouette by dragging edges or corners, select the material type, click "Build," and immediately play their customized piano via an on-screen keyboard or MIDI keyboard.

Technical Stack

Platform: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas

APIs: Web Audio API (simplified physical modeling), Web MIDI API

Simplified Gameplay Flow

Customization Phase:

Users resize the grand piano silhouette visually, changing length, width, and height.

Select piano body material from a simple dropdown or toggle.

Building Phase:

Clicking the "Build" button applies dimension and material changes to update the audio synthesis model.

Performance Phase:

Users play the resulting piano sound via virtual keys or connected MIDI device.

Simplified Parameter Design and Mapping

Piano Dimensions

Length: Directly affects string length, influencing pitch, timbre, and sustain.

Longer length → richer bass, fuller tone.

Shorter length → brighter, lighter tone.

Width: Controls the soundboard size, impacting resonance and loudness.

Wider piano → increased resonance and louder volume.

Narrower piano → quieter, less resonant sound.

Height (Body Depth): Alters internal acoustic space, affecting sustain and tone depth.

Taller piano → increased resonance, longer sustain.

Shorter piano → focused, clearer sound, shorter sustain.

Piano Material

Wood: Warm, traditional, rich resonance.

Metal: Bright, metallic tone, prominent overtones.

Composite/Plastic: Clear, controlled resonance, modern and balanced.

UI & Visual Design

Visual Style: 2D minimalistic with monochrome palette and subtle accents.

Interaction:

Draggable corners or edges of a simplified grand piano silhouette.

Minimal dropdown or toggle for selecting material.

UI Components:

Resizable Piano Silhouette: Clearly marked edges or dots indicating draggable points.

Material Selector: Simple, visually appealing dropdown menu or toggle.

Build Button: Prominent, centralized, and easy to access.

Interactive Piano Keys: Minimalistic keyboard at bottom for immediate audio testing.

Technical Considerations (Thinking Process)

Mapping Visual to Audio Parameters

Normalize piano silhouette dimensions (canvas coordinates) into audio parameters.

Length → adjusts fundamental frequency (pitch), sustain, and decay envelope.

Width/Height → affects resonance via convolution reverb or EQ.

Material → changes EQ profile or convolution impulse responses.

Simplified Physical Modeling Synthesis

Hammer Strike: Noise burst modulated by an envelope.

String Vibration: Simplified Karplus-Strong model (noise burst → delay line → feedback), adjusted by length.

Soundboard Resonance: Use convolution reverb with impulse responses matching dimensions and materials.

Audio Node Graph (Simplified):

Noise Burst → Envelope (hammer) → Karplus-Strong Delay Line (string length) → EQ/Filter (material) → Convolution Reverb (body resonance) → Output

Real-time Interaction and Performance

Provide immediate numeric feedback visually while resizing.

Debounce or throttle audio updates to maintain performance.

Web MIDI API Integration

Detect connected MIDI devices at startup.

Map MIDI notes to trigger the generated piano sounds.

Provide on-screen interactive keys as a fallback.

Error Handling and Educational Aspect

Allow all dimension combinations for experimentation.

Optional educational pop-up or tooltips explaining acoustic impacts.

Optimization and Testing

Cross-browser testing for Web Audio and MIDI compatibility.

Optimize UI responsiveness and audio synthesis performance.

Final Development Steps (Summary)

Set up HTML/CSS/Canvas UI.

Implement intuitive dragging to resize piano silhouette.

Map visual changes directly to simplified audio parameters.

Develop simplified physical modeling synthesis with Web Audio.

Integrate Web MIDI and interactive keys.

Optimize performance and provide responsive visual/audio feedback.

This simplified design aims for an engaging, intuitive, and educational user experience, allowing easy experimentation with piano acoustics.
